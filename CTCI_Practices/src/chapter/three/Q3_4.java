/**
 * In the classis problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and n disks of
 * different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted
 * in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an
 * even larger one). You have the following constraints:
 * 
 * 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * 2. A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower.
 * 3. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
 * 
 * Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
